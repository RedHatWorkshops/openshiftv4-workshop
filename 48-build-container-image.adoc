== Build Container Images

In this exercise we will learn how to create a container image based on Red Hat's
Universal Base Image (UBI) for a PHP application.

The default Dockerfile uses the standard UBI image for RHEL 7 and PHP with Apache
HTTPd from the Software Collections Library (SCL).

There are also Dockerfile variants using UBI for RHEL 8 and the minimal UBI
container images. The RHEL 8 variants take PHP and Apache HTTPd from AppStreams
because there are no more SCLs for RHEL 8.

For more information about UBI, see:

- https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-red-hat-universal-base-image
- https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html-single/building_running_and_managing_containers/index?lb_target=stage#using_red_hat_universal_base_images_standard_minimal_and_runtimes

For more information about SCL, see:

=== Getting a Red Hat Developer's Acccout

- You need a Red Hat Developer's account to grab the service account user name and
token to download the UBI base images. It is free. :-) You can also use the
unauthenticated registry while it is still available.
  * Register and create account at https://developers.redhat.com
  * Login to https://developers.redhat.com
  * Go to https://access.redhat.com/terms-based-registry/
  * Click `New Service Accout` to create your registry service account
  * Enter your unique service account label to the `Name` and `Description`
  * Click `Create`
  * Click to `OpenShift Secret`
  * Download the secret yaml file to your local filesystem (save this later for this lab)


=== Create a project

IMPORTANT: Please replace *Username* with your username. It should be all lowercase and no spaces.

- login to web UI via {{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}
- Use the same username and password that assigned to you
- On the left-hand side menu, select `Home` and then select `Project`
- Click `Create Project`
- Enter *buildimage-Username* as `Name` of the project. The display name and description is optional.

image::create-project.png[image]

- Click `Create`

- Alternatively, you can run this command below via CLI.
....
$ oc new-project buildimage-Username
....

=== Create an application that uses Dockerfile

What you can build your container image locally via podman or docker CLI with
similar steps as shown below.

....
$ git clone https://github.com/flozanorht/testphp-ubi.git
$ cd testphp
$ sudo podman login -u <your service account name> -p <your service account token>
$ sudo podman build -t php-ubi .
$ sudo podman run --name hello -p 8080:8080 -d localhost/php-ubi
$ curl localhost:8080
<html>
<body>
Hello world!
</body>
</html>
$ sudo podman stop hello
$ sudo podman rm hello
....

With OpenShift, we will be building the container image on OpenShift, deploy it
as an application, and ready to be consume.

- Download your service account from https://access.redhat.com/terms-based-registry/ as an OpenShift secret as shown in the previous section.
- Save the secret yaml file to your local filesystem as my-service-account-pull-secret.yaml
- Login to the CLI terminal and execute the following
- Create a secret from the file you downloaded from last step.

NOTE: If you are using the web termainal, you will have to create a file with the
same content of the secret file in your web terminal.

....
$ oc project buildimage-Username
$ oc create -f my-service-account-pull-secret.yaml
....

- Links that secret to your project's builder service account. Your secret name may be different from the one listed.

....
[~] $ oc get secrets
NAME                              TYPE                                  DATA
AGE
12182981-shannachan-pull-secret   kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson        1


[~] $ oc secrets link builder 12182981-shannachan-pull-secret
....

NOTE: Make sure your secret name matches the command to link to the service account.


- Create an application via the Dockerfile

....
[~] $ oc new-app --name hello https://github.com/piggyvenus/testphp-ubi.git
--> Found Docker image c096c0d (5 weeks old) from registry.redhat.io for "regis
try.redhat.io/ubi7/ubi"

    Red Hat Universal Base Image 7
    ------------------------------
    The Universal Base Image is designed and engineered to be the base layer fo
r all of your containerized applications, middleware and utilities. This base i
mage is freely redistributable, but Red Hat only supports Red Hat technologies
through subscriptions for Red Hat products. This image is maintained by Red Hat
 and updated regularly.

    Tags: base rhel7

    * An image stream tag will be created as "ubi:latest" that will track the s
ource image
    * A Docker build using source code from https://github.com/piggyvenus/testp
hp-ubi.git will be created
      * The resulting image will be pushed to image stream tag "hello:latest"
      * Every time "ubi:latest" changes a new build will be triggered
    * This image will be deployed in deployment config "hello"
    * Port 8080/tcp will be load balanced by service "hello"
      * Other containers can access this service through the hostname "hello"
    * WARNING: Image "registry.redhat.io/ubi7/ubi" runs as the 'root' user whic
h may not be permitted by your cluster administrator
