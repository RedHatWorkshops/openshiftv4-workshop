= Managing Users Overview

== Managing Users Overview

In this lab you will learn how OpenShift manages users and how
authentication is handled. You will also learn how to add/delete users
from the OpenShift platform.

=== Out of the Box

OpenShift 4 installs with two effective superusers out of the box:

- kubeadmin (technically an alias for kube:admin)
- system:admin

Why two? Because system:admin is a user that uses a certificate to login and has
no password. Therefore this superuser cannot log-in to the web console (which
requires a password).

=== Create the htpasswd file

OpenShift takes "hands off" approach in managing users. That is,
OpenShift does not manage users directly. Instead it "offloads" the
user administration to whatever mechanism you choose.

Currently supported authentication methods are:

* LDAP
* HTPassword File
* Github
* Gitlab
* OpenID
* Google
* Request Header
* Basic authentication
* Keystone

https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/authentication/understanding-identity-provider.html#supported-identity-providers

=== Configure HTPASSWD Provider

In this example, we are going to setup `htpasswd` which is a "flat file" for
authentication.

==== Create a htpasswd file

- Create the file manually, run the below command where you get access to openssl.

....
$ printf "devday01:$(openssl passwd -apr1 openshift4)\n" >> ~/htpasswd-dd"
....

This will create a user called devday01 with password `openshift4`.

- Alternatively, if you don't want to create a file

....
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatWorkshops/openshiftv4-workshop/master/solutions/htpasswd-dd
....

NOTE: 3 users will be created using this file. They are devday01, devday02, and devday03. Password as *openshift4*

==== Using CLI (OPTION 1)

===== Create htpasswd secret

The authentication operator will read the htpasswd file from a secret in the
openshift-config project. Go ahead and create that secret using the following command:

....
$ oc create secret generic htpass-dd-secret --from-file=htpasswd=htpasswd-dd -n openshift-config
....

NOTE: The above command assumes that htpasswd-dd is the filename that you're
wanting to use, and is in your current working directory. If it's not, you will
need to specify the full location.

==== Create the Identities Provider Custom Resource

The operator that configures authentication is looking for a CustomResource object.
In our case, we want one that tells it to configure htpasswd authentication using
the provided secret. Here's what that definition looks like:

- Save this file as htpasswd-dd-cr.yaml

....
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: OAuth
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  identityProviders:
  - name: dd_htpasswd_provider
    challenge: true
    login: true
    mappingMethod: claim
    type: HTPasswd
    htpasswd:
      fileData:
        name: htpass-dd-secret
....


- Create the Custom Resource for auth with the command here:

....
$ oc apply -f htpasswd-dd-cr.yaml
....

==== Configure the Oauth on the Web Console (Option 2)

- Login to OpenShift Console {{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}
- Navigate to `Administration` --> `Cluster Settings`
- Click `Global Configuration` tab
- Click `OAuth`
- Click `Add` --> `HTPasswd`
- Enter `htpasswd-dd` as `Name`

- Click `Browse` to select the htpasswd-dd file that was created previously

image::ocp4-oauth-htpasswd.png[image]

- Click `Add`

image::ocp4-oauth-htpasswd.png[image]

=== Test Authentication

- Login via web terminal

....
$ oc login -u devday01 -p openshift4
....

- Now check OpenShift. Note that the user you just created is not there.

....
$ oc get users
NAME       UID                                    FULL NAME   IDENTITIES
admin      700eef60-82fd-11e9-9bf6-0a580a82001e               htpasswd:admin
devday01   a30dfe2a-8301-11e9-ae97-0a580a810019               htpasswd-dd:devday01
....

When deleted a user from the backend authentication
system. Just simply delete the user

....
$ oc delete user devday01
user "devday01" deleted
....

You should now see the user gone from the list

....
$ oc get users
NAME      UID                                    FULL NAME       IDENTITIES
admin      700eef60-82fd-11e9-9bf6-0a580a82001e               htpasswd:admin
....

*Re-Using the User* If you want to re-use this user with a later lab
module, you will also need to run the following to finish cleaning up
the user from the backend:

....
$ oc delete identity dd_htpasswd_provider:devday01
....

NOTES: the name of identity is from the output of `oc get users`

*CLEANUP:* If this user was an admin/owner of any projects; those
projects would still exist. You just need to assign them to different
users.

=== Conclusion

In this lab you learned how users are managed inside of OpenShift. You
also go familiar with authentication and how that is handled in
OpenShift
