= Managing Users Overview

== Managing Users Overview

In this lab you will learn how OpenShift manages users and how
authentication is handled. You will also learn how to add/delete users
from the OpenShift platform.

=== Out of the Box

OpenShift 4 installs with two effective superusers out of the box:

- kubeadmin (technically an alias for kube:admin)
- system:admin

Why two? Because system:admin is a user that uses a certificate to login and has
no password. Therefore this superuser cannot log-in to the web console (which
requires a password).

=== Create the htpasswd file

OpenShift takes "hands off" approach in managing users. That is,
OpenShift does not manage users directly. Instead it "offloads" the
user administration to whatever mechanism you choose.

Currently supported authentication methods are:

* LDAP
* HTPassword File
* Github
* Gitlab
* OpenID
* Google
* Request Header
* Basic authentication
* Keystone

More information can be found
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/authentication/understanding-identity-provider.html#supported-identity-providers

In this example, we are going to setup `htpasswd` which is a "flat file" for
authentication.

- Create the file manually, run the below command where you get access to openssl.

....
$ printf "devday01:$(openssl passwd -apr1 openshift4)\n" >> ~/htpasswd-dd"
....

This will create a user called devday01 with password `openshift4`.

- Alternatively, if you don't want to create a file

....
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatWorkshops/openshiftv4-workshop/master/solutions/htpasswd-dd
....

NOTE: 3 users will be created using this file. They are devday01, devday02, and devday03. Password as *openshift4*



=== Create htpasswd secret

The authentication operator will read the htpasswd file from a secret in the
openshift-config project. Go ahead and create that secret using the following command:

....
$ oc create secret generic htpass-dd-secret --from-file=htpasswd=htpasswd-dd -n openshift-config
....

NOTE: The above command assumes that htpasswd-dd is the filename that you're
wanting to use, and is in your current working directory. If it's not, you will
need to specify the full location.

=== Create the Identities Provider Custom Resource

The operator that configures authentication is looking for a CustomResource object.
In our case, we want one that tells it to configure htpasswd authentication using
the provided secret. Here's what that definition looks like:

- Save this file as htpasswd-dd-cr.yaml

....
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: OAuth
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  identityProviders:
  - name: dd_htpasswd_provider
    challenge: true
    login: true
    mappingMethod: claim
    type: HTPasswd
    htpasswd:
      fileData:
        name: htpass-dd-secret
....

- Create the Custom Resource for auth with the command here:

....
oc apply -f htpasswd-dd-cr.yaml
....

=== Test Authentication

....
oc login -u devday01 -p openshift4
....

- Now check OpenShift. Note that the user you just created is not there.

....
oc get users
NAME       UID                                    FULL NAME       IDENTITIES
dmin       9fb78e55-8163-11e9-a965-0a580a800020                   my_htpasswd_provider:admin
devday01   8423f1bc-81e0-11e9-95da-0a580a810022                   dd_htpasswd_provider:devday01
....

When deleted a user from the backend authentication
system. Just simply delete the user

....
oc delete user devday01
user "devday01" deleted
....

You should now see the user gone from the list

....
oc get users
NAME      UID                                    FULL NAME       IDENTITIES
dmin      9fb78e55-8163-11e9-a965-0a580a800020                   my_htpasswd_provider:admin
....

*Re-Using the User* If you want to re-use this user with a later lab
module, you will also need to run the following to finish cleaning up
the user from the backend:

....
oc delete identity htpasswd_auth:devday01
....

*CLEANUP:* If this user was an admin/owner of any projects; those
projects would still exist. You just need to assign them to different
users.

=== Conclusion

In this lab you learned how users are managed inside of OpenShift. You
also go familiar with authentication and how that is handled in
OpenShift
