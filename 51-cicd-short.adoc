== Creating a Pipeline

In this lab, we will learn to create a build pipeline on OpenShift. This
pipeline will be setup using Jenkins running as an application pod on
OpenShift. The pipeline running on Jenkins will trigger builds and
deployments on OpenShift.


=== Create a new project

IMPORTANT: Please replace *Username* with your username. It should be all lowercase and no spaces.

- login to web UI via {{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}
- Use the same username and password that assigned to you
- On the left-hand side menu, select `Home` and then select `Project`
- Click `Create Project`
- Enter *pipeline-Username* as `Name` of the project. The display name and description is optional.

- Click `Create`

- Alternatively, you can run this command below via CLI.

=== Deploy your CI/CD tool (Jenkins)

- Let's lookup the jenkins template from the terminal and execute the following

```
~] $ oc get templates -n openshift | grep jenkins
jenkins-ephemeral                               Jenkins service, without persistent storage....
         7 (all set)       6
jenkins-persistent                              Jenkins service, with persistent storage....
         9 (all set)       7
```

- Getting Jenkins up and Running

```
[~] $ oc new-app jenkins-ephemeral
 -> Deploying template "openshift/jenkins-ephemeral" to project testme2

     Jenkins (Ephemeral)
     ---------
     Jenkins service, without persistent storage.

     WARNING: Any data stored will be lost upon pod destruction. Only use this template for testing.

     A Jenkins service has been created in your project.  Log into Jenkins with your OpenShift account.  The tutorial at h
ttps://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/jenkins/README.md contains more information about using this templ
ate.

        * Jenkins ImageStream Namespace=openshift
        * Disable memory intensive administrative monitors=false

```

- Login to web console
- Navigate to `Projects`
- Click on the newly created project
- Navigate to `Networking` -> `Routes`
- Click the link under `LOCATION`
- Click `Advanced`
- Click `Proceed to jenkins-...`
- Click `Log in with OpenShift`

- Click `my_htpasswd_provider`
- Login using your user name
- Click `Allow selected permissions`
- You now login the Jenkins console

=== Pipeline setup

- Create pipeline

```
[~] $ oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/origin/master/examples/jenkins/pipeline/nodejs-sample-pipeline
.yaml
buildconfig.build.openshift.io/nodejs-sample-pipeline created
```

- Grant permissions to jenkins sevice account for access to the project.

```
[~] $ oc adm policy add-role-to-user admin system:serviceaccount:pipeline-Username:jenkins -n pipeline-Username
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/admin added: "system:serviceaccount:pipeline-Username:jenkins"
```

NOTE: *pipeline-Username* will be replaced to your project name

- Go back to your web console
- Navigate to `Build` --> `Build Configs`
- Click onto `nodejs-sample-pipeline`
- Click `Actions` dropdown on the top right
- Select `Start Build`
- Build starts as show below

- Click `View Logs`
- Click `Open Blue Ocean` from the Jenkins Console

Congratulations!! In this lab, you have learnt how to set up and run
your own CI/CD pipeline on OpenShift.
