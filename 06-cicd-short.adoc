== Creating a Pipeline

In this lab, we will learn to create a build pipeline on OpenShift. This
pipeline will be setup using Jenkins running as an application pod on
OpenShift. The pipeline running on Jenkins will trigger builds and
deployments on OpenShift.


=== Create a new project

IMPORTANT: Please replace *Username* with your username. It should be all lowercase and no spaces.

- login to web UI via {{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}
- Use the same username and password that assigned to you
- On the left-hand side menu, select `Home` and then select `Project`
- Click `Create Project`
- Enter *pipeline-Username* as `Name` of the project. The display name and description is optional.

- Click `Create`

- Alternatively, you can run this command below via CLI.

=== Deploy your CI/CD tool (Jenkins)

- Login to the cluster via {{API_URL}}

```
[~]$ oc login {{API_URL}}
The server uses a certificate signed by an unknown authority.
You can bypass the certificate check, but any data you send to the server could be intercepted
by others.
Use insecure connections? (y/n): y

Authentication required for https://api.cluster-d724.sandbox182.opentlc.com:6443 (openshift)
Username: admin01
Password:
Login successful.
```

- Make sure you switch project to your `pipeline-Username` project

[source,shell]
----
[~]$ oc project pipline-user01
----

- Let's lookup the jenkins template from the terminal and execute the following

```
[~]$ oc get templates -n openshift | grep jenkins
jenkins-ephemeral                               Jenkins service, without persistent storage....
         7 (all set)       6
jenkins-persistent                              Jenkins service, with persistent storage....
         9 (all set)       7
```

- Getting Jenkins up and Running

```
[~]$ oc new-app jenkins-ephemeral
 -> Deploying template "openshift/jenkins-ephemeral" to project testme2

     Jenkins (Ephemeral)
     ---------
     Jenkins service, without persistent storage.

     WARNING: Any data stored will be lost upon pod destruction. Only use this template for testing.

     A Jenkins service has been created in your project.  Log into Jenkins with your OpenShift account.
     The tutorial at https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/jenkins/README.md contains
     more information about using this template.

     * With parameters:
        * Jenkins Service Name=jenkins
        * Jenkins JNLP Service Name=jenkins-jnlp
        * Enable OAuth in Jenkins=true
        * Memory Limit=1Gi
        * Jenkins ImageStream Namespace=openshift
        * Disable memory intensive administrative monitors=false
        * Jenkins ImageStreamTag=jenkins:2

```

- Back to web console {{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}
- Navigate to `Networking` --> `Routes`
- Click the link under `LOCATION`
- Click `Advanced`
- Click the link where `Proceed to jenkins-...`
- Click `Log in with OpenShift`

- Click `htpasswd`
- Login using your user name
- Click `Allow selected permissions`
- You now login the Jenkins console

=== Pipeline setup

- Create pipeline via web terminal

[source,shell]
----
[~]$ oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/origin/master/examples/jenkins/pipeline/nodejs-sample-pipeline.yaml

buildconfig.build.openshift.io/nodejs-sample-pipeline created
----

- Grant permissions to jenkins sevice account for access to the project.

```
[~] $ oc adm policy add-role-to-user admin system:serviceaccount:pipeline-Username:jenkins -n pipeline-Username
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/admin added: "system:serviceaccount:pipeline-Username:jenkins"
```

NOTE: *pipeline-Username* will be replaced to your project name

- Go back to your web console {{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}
- Navigate to `Build` --> `Build Configs`
- Click onto `nodejs-sample-pipeline`
- Click `Actions` dropdown on the top right
- Select `Start Build`
- Build starts as show below

image::jenkins-viewlog.png[image]

- Click `View Logs`
- Click `Open Blue Ocean` from the Jenkins Console

image::jenkins-build.png[image]

- Blue Ocean console here (may take a minute to show up):

image::blue-ocean.png[image]

- Go back to OpenShift web console

- When Pipleline build is completed, navigate `Network` --> `Route`
- Click onto the link under `LOCATION` for `nodejs-mongodb-example`

Congratulations!! In this lab, you have learnt how to set up and run
your own CI/CD pipeline on OpenShift.
