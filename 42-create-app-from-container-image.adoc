== Create an App from a Container image

In this lab you will learn how to create a new project on OpenShift and
how to create an application from an existing docker image using Web UI.

=== Add a new project

IMPORTANT: Please replace *Username* with your username

- login to web UI via {{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}
- Use the same username and password that assigned to you
- On the left-hand side menu, select `Home` and then select `Project`
- Click `Create Project`
- Enter *web-terminal-Username* as name of the project. The display name and description is optional.

- Click `Create`

=== Deploy an Image

- Click `Deploy Image`, or in the top-right click the *Add* drop-down menu, then select `Deploy Image`
- Enter `quay.io/openshiftlabs/workshop-terminal:2.4.0` in the `Image Name` box,
  noting that there's no `http://`, enter exactly as shown here,
  without the quotes
- Select the magnifying glass icon to the right of the box
- Use the default `Name` for the deployment
- Scroll down a bit and provide an environment variable.
- Add `OC_VERSION` and `4.1` as `Environment Variable` section at the bottom on the page.

- Click `Deploy`
- On the left-hand side menu, select `Workload` --> `Deployments Configs`
- Click onto the `workshop-terminal` to see the deployment details here

- Navigate to `Home` --> `Events` to check status on each events.

Events in OpenShift Container Platform are modeled based on events that happen
to API objects in an OpenShift Container Platform cluster. Events allow OpenShift
Container Platform to record information about real-world events in a resource-
agnostic manner. For more information, please see
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/security/monitoring.html#security-monitoring-events.

== Create route

Next we need to create a route so we can access this application from the outside of OpenShift (i.e. from the internet).

- Navigate to `Networking` --> `Routes`
- Click `Create Route` in the top-left
- Enter `workshop-terminal` for the name of the route, leave the hostname and path the default
- Select `workshop-terminal` from the list of services in the `Service` menu
- Select the only port in the `Target Port` drop down (should be port 10080 --> 10080), like this:

- Click `Create` at the bottom and it will create the route.
- You will now be presented with a pane that shows the overview of the route:

=== Accessing the terminal

- In the top right hand side of the route details page, you will see the `LOCATION`
which will be the routable URL that will provide access to our workshop terminal.
- Click on the link under `LOCATION` and you will see the in-browser terminal
session that we can use (if preferred, or mandated due to connectivity issues):

=== Setup OC CLI in web terminal

- Execute the following in the terminal:

....
$ wget {{LINUX_CLI_URL}}
$ tar zvxf openshift-client-linux-4.1.0.tar.gz
$ mv oc /opt/app-root/bin/
$ oc version
....

NOTE: If normal cut/paste does not work, you can try to use browser's edit menu for cut/paste.

=== To login to a remote server

[source,shell]
----
$ oc login {{API_URL}}
----

NOTE: Username and password will be provided by your instructor.


Congratulations!! You now know how to create a project, an application
using an external docker image and navigate around. You also install OC CLI on
the web terminal to access the cluster via CLI.
