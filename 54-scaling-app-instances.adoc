= Scale up and Scale down and Idle the application instances

== Scale up and Scale down and Idle the application instances

In this exercise we will learn how to scale our application. OpenShift
has the capability to scale your application and make sure that many
instances are always running.

=== Switch to an existing project

IMPORTANT: Please replace *Username* with the username assigned to you in
the commands below.

For this exercise, we will be using an already running application. We
will be using the `buildimage-Username` that you created in the
previous labs. Make sure you are switched to that project by using the
`oc project` command.

- login to web UI via {{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}
- Use the same username and password that assigned to you
- Navigate to `Projects`
- Click onto the `buildimage-Username`


=== View the deployment config

Take a look at the `deploymentConfig` (or `dc`) of the `time`
application

- Navigate to `Workloads` --> Deployment Configs
- Click onto `hello` the name of the dc
- Click `YAML` tab

      reason: NewReplicationControllerAvailable
      message: replication controller "hello-1" successfully rolled out
  replicas: 1
  readyReplicas: 1
....

Note that the `replicas:` is set to `1`. This tells OpenShift that when
this application deploys, make sure that there is 1 instance.

The `Replication Controller` mirrors this configuration initially; the
`Replication Controller` (or `rc`) will ensure that there is always the
set number of instances always running.

To view the `rc` for your application first get the current pod running.

- Navigate to `Workloads` --> `Pods`
- Let us view the `rc` on this build.
- Navigate to `Workloads` --> `Replication Controllers`

NOTE: You can change the number of replicas in `DeploymentConfig` or
the `ReplicationController`.

However note that if you change the `deploymentConfig` it applies to
your application. This means, even if you delete the current replication
controller, the new one that gets created will be assigned the REPLICAS
value based on what is set for DC. If you change it on the Replication
Controller, the application will scale up. But if you happen to delete
the current replication controller for some reason, you will loose that
setting.

=== Scale Application

To scale your application we will edit the `deploymentConfig` to 3.

- Navigate to `Workloads` --> `Deployment Configs`
- Click onto `hello` DC

image::scale-overview.png[image]

- Click the `pencil` icon under `DESIRED COUNT`

image::scale-up.png[image]

- Click `+` to increase to `3`
- Click `Save`

image::scale-3pods-overview.png[image]

- Wait for all 3 pods are available
- Click `Pods`
- you will see that there are 3 pods running now

image::scale-3pods.png[image]

NOTES: You can also scale up and down from updating the deployment config.


=== Idling the application

Run the following command to find the available endpoints

....
[~] $ oc get endpoints
NAME    ENDPOINTS                                            AGE
hello   10.128.2.30:8080,10.129.2.47:8080,10.131.0.33:8080   23m
....

Note that the name of the endpoints is `hello` and there are three ips
addresses for the three pods.

Run the `oc idle endpoints/hello` command to idle the application

....
[~] $ oc idle endpoints/hello
WARNING: idling when network policies are in place may cause connections to bypass network policy entirely
The service "buildimage-user01/hello" has been marked as idled
The service will unidle DeploymentConfig "buildimage-user01/hello" to 3 replicas once it receives traffic
DeploymentConfig "buildimage-user01/hello" has been idled
....

- Go back to the webconsole. You will notice that the pods show up as
idled.
- Navigate to `Workloads` --> `Pods`

image::idle-pod.png[image]

At this point the application is idled, the pods are not running and no
resources are being used by the application. This doesn't mean that the
application is deleted. The current state is just saved that's all.

=== Reactivate your application

- Navigate to `Networking` --> `Routes`
- Now click on the application route URL under `LOCATION`

Note that it takes a little while for the application to respond. This
is because pods are spinning up again. You can notice that in the web
console.

In a little while the output comes up and your application would be up
with 3 pods.

So, as soon as the user accesses the application, it comes up!!!

=== Scaling Down

Scaling down is the same procedure as scaling up.

- Navigate to `Workloads` --> `Deployment Configs`
- Click on to the DC `hello`
- Click `pencil` icon under `DESIRED COUNT`
- Click `-` twice and down to 1
- Click `Save`
- Now, you only have 1 pod running

Congratulations!! In this exercise you have learned about scaling and
how to scale up/down your application on OpenShift!
