= OpenShift 4 as a Developer

== OpenShift 4 as a Developer

In this lab, we're aiming to get you familiar with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.0 from a developer perspective, using container-native developer tooling to develop and deploy a sample app with Red Hat Middleware. It's comprised of a number of individual steps inside of this section that will run you through some of the more common tasks:

 * Deploying application services to developer projects with OpenShift Operators and the Operator Hub.
 * Creating development environments with CodeReady Workspaces
 * Building and deploying a sample app with odo and Red Hat Middleware
 * A preview of a new middleware framework named Quarkus, with features like a unified Reactive and Imperative programming model, native image compilation, blazingly fast startup times, and Live Reloading of Java code.


=== Install Operators

In this lab we will use CodeReady to create and work with a sample app based on
Red Hat Data Grid. To get access to CodeReady and Data Grid services, you need
to point to a special repo containing operator catalog entries. Install this
catalog using the following oc command, noting that you'll have to copy from cat
to EOF, and paste it in. This will create a custom OperatorSource object that
will bring in the Operator catalog items needed for this workshop and make it
available via OperatorHub:

```
cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorSource
metadata:
  name: devday-operators
  namespace: openshift-marketplace
spec:
  type: appregistry
  endpoint: https://quay.io/cnr
  registryNamespace: jamesfalkner
  displayName: "OCP 4 Dev Day"
  publisher: "Red Hat"
EOF
```

If it was successful you should see the following:

```
operatorsource.operators.coreos.com/devday-operators created
```

=== Create Project

Let's first create a developer project.

IMPORTANT: Please replace *Username* with your username. It should be all lowercase and no spaces.

- login to web UI via {{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}
- Use the same username and password that assigned to you
- On the left-hand side menu, select `Home` and then select `Project`
- Click `Create Project`
- Enter *devday-Username* as name of the project. The display name and description is optional.

- Click `Create`

- Alternatively, you can run this command below via CLI.
....
$ oc project mycliproject-userxx
....


Alternatively, if you're more comfortable with the CLI, you can do it with oc new-project devday-**Username**

=== Install Red Hat Data Grid

In our new project we will first deploy Red Hat Data Grid, a high performance,
distributed data grid which our sample application will use for its reactive
capabilities.

- Navigate to `Catalog` -> `Operator Hub` in the OpenShift Console.
- Search for `grid` or browse to find Red Hat Data Grid
- Click on `Red Hat Data Grid`, and then click Install:

image::datagrid-operator.png[image]

- Select your new namespace, so be sure to choose `"`A specific Namespace on the
cluster` and choose your new project devday-**Username**
- Click `Subscribe` to install the operator into the namespace (leave everything else on the default settings):

image::datagrid-sub.png[image]

- Navigate to `Catalog` -> `Installed Operators`
- Click on the `Red Hat Data Grid operator` (if you do not see it yet, it may take a few minutes to appear):

image::datagrid-installed.png[image]

- Click on the "Red Hat Data Grid" name on the left,
- Click `Create New`
- Don't change anything in the YAML file defaults, and click Create.
This will cause Red Hat Data Grid to be deployed to your project's namespace and can now be used by projects.
- Navigate to `Workloads` -> `Pods` you'll be able to see the Data Grid pods spinning up:

image::datagrid-app.png[image]


=== Install CodeReady

CodeReady is Red Hat's browser-based intelligent developer IDE. We'll use the
CodeReady operator to deploy CodeReady so that we can use it in our project
to develop our apps.

- Navigate to `Catalog` > `Operator Hub`.
- Search for codeready or browse the catalog to find the CodeReady Operator
- click on `Red Hat CodeReady`

image::codeready-operator.png[image]

- Click `Install`
- Under choose `"`A specific Namespace on the cluster` -> choose devday-**Username**
- Click `Subscribe` to install the operator into the namespace (leave everything else on the default settings):

image::codeready-install.png[image]

- As an Operator administrator, run this command before proceeding:

```
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin system:serviceaccount:devday-user01:codeready-operator -n devday-user01
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/cluster-admin added: "system:serviceaccount:devday-user1:codeready-operator"
```

- Navigate to `Catalog` -> `Installed Operators`
- Click on the CodeReady operator on the left-hand side.
- Click `Create New` on the CodeReady tile. Don't change anything in the YAML file defaults
- Click `Create`.
- Wait for several minutes to complete, and will install CodeReady into the devday-**Username** namespace.
Once you see all 3 pods in the Running state using this command, then you can proceed:

```
$ oc get pods -n devday-user01
NAME                                  READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
codeready-operator-64b485c5f7-4t28t   1/1     Running     0          4m4s
datagrid-1-deploy                     0/1     Completed   0          17m
datagrid-1-g72jm                      1/1     Running     0          17m
datagrid-operator-7f6c5c5cd4-hsnk7    1/1     Running     0          20m
```

- update postgres deployment yaml'registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/postgresql-10-rhel7:1-35'
- delete postgres pod
- delete PVC postgres-data PVC
- scale down/scale up the deployments
- Navigate to `Workloads` --> `Pods` and wait for all pods to be ready

image::codeready-pods.png[image]

Be sure to wait for all of these to be ready and Running before continuing.

=== Install Custom Stack

CodeReady comes with several out-of-the-box stacks for different developer scenarios,
but we want to create a custom stack that will give us access to a few custom tools
within our workspaces.

- Figure out the URL for CodeReady, run the following command in your Terminal:

```
[~] $ echo http://$(oc get route codeready -n devday-user01 -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}{"\n"}')
http://codeready-devday-user01.apps.cluster-4c7b.sandbox575.opentlc.com
```

NOTE: `devday-user01` is my namespace

- Open the URL in your browser
- Click `Register` and create a new account using this information
(it doesn't really matter what you put as long as you supply a valid-looking email address)

image::codeready-register.png[image]

- Login as your newly created user
- Open browser with URL below

```
[~] $ echo http://$(oc get route codeready -n devday-user01 -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}{"\n"}')/swagger
http://codeready-devday-user01.apps.cluster-4c7b.sandbox575.opentlc.com/swagger
```

image::codeready-swagger.png[image]

- Click `Stack` API
- Click `POST /stack`
- Paste the following content into the body of the request

}
```

- Click `Try it out!`
- You should get HTTP `201` similar as shown below

=== Create CodeReady Workspace with custom Java stacks

CodeReady has the concept of Workspaces which are team collaboration areas for
different projects. Let's create a new Workspace and base it on our new stack we created.

- Navigate back to the CodeReady homepage via this URL on your browser:

```
[~] $ echo http://$(oc get route codeready -n devday-user01 -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}{"\n"}')
http://codeready-devday-user01.apps.cluster-4c7b.sandbox575.opentlc.com
```

- Login as user01 if you are not logged in
- `New Workspace` page should be opened
- If not, click `Create Workspace`
- Select the stack titled as `Devday - Java`
- Click `Create & Open`

image::codeready-workspace.png[image]

==== Workaround for bug

This bug prevents CodeReady Workspaces from starting up the first time on OCP 4.

- Go to the CodeReady main page
- Click on Workspaces (1)
- Click the "Stop" button (square shape) next to your new workspace:

image::codeready-stop.png[image]

- You may get an error popup which you can ignore (regarding failed runtime start).
- Click the `Start` button (Triangle/Play shape) to restart the workspace, which should workaround the bug.
- Click the name of the workspace on the left menu (under RECENT WORKSPACES) to watch the workspace start up.

After a while you should see a successful startup and empty project:

image::codeready-ready.png[image]

- Click `Import Project...` to import the example application we'll be working with.
- Choose GitHub as the source of the import
- Use `https://github.com/infinispan-demos/harry-potter-quarkus` as git URL
- Click `Import`

image::codeready-github.png[image]

- Select `Java` -> `Maven` project type
- Click `Save`.
You've now imported the sample app, and should be able to see the codebase on
the left project navigator:

image::codeready-project.png[image]

==== Configure project

- Open the sample application's configuration file at src/main/resources/application.properties.
- Replace the contents of this file with the following code:

```
quarkus.http.port=8080
quarkus.http.host=0.0.0.0
quarkus.infinispan-client.server-list=datagrid-hotrod.devday-user01:11222

characters.filename = hp_characters.csv
spells.filename = hp_spells.csv
```

- This will cause our application to listen on TCP port 8080, across all interfaces
- Use the Data Grid service we previously installed: `datagrid-hotrod.devday-user01`

    * datagrid-hotrod is the name of the service
    * devday-user01 is the namespace used in this example

==== Test locally

Typically you will want to test your code first, before deploying to OpenShift.

- On the top menu bar, you'll see a big blue "Play" button;
- Select that and choose Build and Run Locally. It will take a minute or two to download dependencies,
then it should be ready when you start seeing log file messages in the bottom right corner of the window like:





Congratulations!! You now know how to install operators and deploy application
via OperatorHub. From more information about operator, see
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/applications/operators/olm-what-operators-are.html
for more details.
