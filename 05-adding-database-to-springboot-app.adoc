Adding a backend database to the SpringBoot application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:data-uri:

In this exercise we will add a backend database to the previous deployed
SpringBoot application.

IMPORTANT: Please replace *userxx* with the username assigned to you in
the commands below.

If you already created the SpringBoot application in the previous lab, just test one more thing. Try your application url
with `/dbtest` (http://bootapp-spring-userxx.{{APPS_ADDRESS}}/dbtest) extension and it should list you some data from
the HSQLDB configured within the same app.

Let's take a moment to understand how this application is connecting to
the HSQLDB. Look at the `application.properties` file in the code
https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app/blob/master/application.properties
and we have configured these spring datasource variables to use hsqldb.

....
spring.datasource.platform=hsqldb
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:hsqldb:file:/opt/app-root/src/mydb;shutdown=true
spring.datasource.username=user
spring.datasource.password=password
....

Of course,
https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app/blob/master/pom.xml
has the required dependencies. So springboot is able to create the in
memory database.

Where is the data coming from? See these two files:

* https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app/blob/master/src/main/resources/schema-hsqldb.sql
is creating the schema
* https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app/blob/master/src/main/resources/data-hsqldb.sql
is adding data.

This is the data displayed when you invoke dbtest endpoint. Pretty
straight forward.. isn't it!!

In this lab, we will deploy the same as a 2-tier application by adding a
MySQL database running as a separate pod.

*Step 1: Add a MySQL database to this project*

Based on what you learnt in the previous labs, you know what to do!!

IMPORTANT: Please replace *userxx* with the username assigned to you in
the commands below.

Make sure you are in the `spring-userxx` project where your springboot
application is running. Click on `Add to project` on your webconsole,
select `MySQL Ephemeral` from the catalog and deploy it.

When you are deploying this database you will have to choose the following values:
*Database Service Name:* mysql +
*MySQL Connection Username:* user +
*MySQL Connection Password:* password +
*MySQL Database Name:* sampledb

_Feel free to use your own values, but make a note of the same_ (write
down..we will need these)

Click on the `Create` button and within a few min or two your MySQL
database pod should be up and running.

*Step 2: Configuring database connection params*

The simplest way is to edit `application.properties` file to the values
you noted in the last step i.e.

....
spring.datasource.platform=mysql
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://mysql.spring-userxx:3306/sampledb?useSSL=false
spring.datasource.username=user
spring.datasource.password=password
....

But wait, that requires you to rebuild he code and deploy.

So, is there another way?.. *Yes* Let's use a `ConfigMap`.

ConfigMaps allow you to keep the configuration artifacts decoupled from
the image content. More details
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/dev_guide/configmaps.html[here].
We will see use them here and understand their _flexibility_ in the next
lab.

Lets create configMap in the Web UI.

IMPORTANT: Please replace *username* with the username assigned to you in
the commands below.

- Click into the `spring-username` project if you are not in the project
- Click `Resources` --> `Config Maps`
- Click `Create Config Map` on top right
- Enter `app-props` as Name
- Enter `application.properties` as key
- Copy and paste following contents to the value text area
  Make sure you update the `userxx` and the values match what you gave when creating MySQL database

  ```
  spring.datasource.platform=mysql
  spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://mysql.spring-userxx:3306/sampledb?useSSL=false
  spring.datasource.username=user
  spring.datasource.password=password
  ```

- Click `Create`

  You need to make sure that you substitute the correct values you noted
  in the last step when you are creating the service. *Be extra-careful..
  read instructions below.*
  Specifically note the datasource url. It is in the following format:
  `spring.datasource.url = jdbc:<<databasetype>>://<<service-host>>:<<service-port>>/<<dbname>>?useSSL=false`

  You can replace `service-host` by the IP address of your MySQL service
  or the Service name. In the above example, I am using the service name
  for example `mysql.spring-userxx`. Here `mysql` is the name of the
  service and `spring-userxx` is the project name. This is a fully
  qualified way to let your application do service discovery in OpenShift
  (it uses SkyDNS).


  If you made a mistake you can always edit the ConfigMap using

  So far, we have created a ConfigMap in the project but your springboot
  application does not know how to use it.

*Step 3: Edit Deployment Configuration*

Now we will mount the ConfigMap so that the springboot application can
use it. You can either edit from CLI or from WebConsole.

* If using WebConsole, navigate to
`Applications`->`Deployments`->`bootapp`. The screen should show
Deployment Configuration details for the `bootapp` application. On the
right top, choose `Actions` dropdown and `Edit YAML`.
* If you are doing from CLI, you can run `oc edit dc bootapp`

Scroll down to container spec, that looks like this:

....
    spec:
      containers:
        -
          name: bootapp
          image: '172.30.85.130:5000/spring-userxx/bootapp@sha256:79e188d712e1209b933870c7d064423af281f16b371fb5e5911dfb09a6867776'
          ports:
            -
              containerPort: 8080
              protocol: TCP
          resources:
          terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
          imagePullPolicy: Always
      restartPolicy: Always
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      securityContext:
....

Note there could be multiple `spec`s in your DC.

We will now add a volume that points to our ConfigMap right under
`spec`. It is explained here
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/dev_guide/configmaps.html#configmaps-use-case-consuming-in-volumes

....
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: app-props-volume
      configMap:
        name: app-props
....

WARNING: Be super-careful with indentation

We will now add `volumeMount` to mount the `volume` that we just added
into the pod. It should be right under the container `name:` as shown
below.

....
      containers:
        -
          name: bootapp
          volumeMounts:
          - name: app-props-volume
            mountPath: /opt/app-root/src/config
....

WARNING: Be super-careful with indentation

After the changes, the `template` section in the dc, should now look
like this

....
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: bootapp
        deploymentconfig: bootapp
    spec:
      volumes:
        - name: app-props-volume
          configMap:
            name: app-props
      containers:
        -
          name: bootapp
          volumeMounts:
          - name: app-props-volume
            mountPath: /opt/app-root/src/config
          image: '172.30.85.130:5000/spring-userxx/bootapp@sha256:79e188d712e1209b933870c7d064423af281f16b371fb5e5911dfb09a6867776'
          ports:
            -
              containerPort: 8080
              protocol: TCP
          resources:
          terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
          imagePullPolicy: Always
      restartPolicy: Always
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      securityContext:
....


So what is this location `/opt/app-root/src/config`?

If you get into the terminal of the pod (you should know how to do this
by now!) and run `pwd`, it will show that the `home` directory is
`/opt/app-root/src`. If you copy the `application.properties` file in
the `config` folder, SpringBoot will pick that first. Hence we mounted
the folder `/opt/app-root/src/config`.

Save the changes and exit. If you now got the `Overview` page, you will
see that the pod gets re-deployed. Yes, redeployed, not rebuilt (no S2I
build process).

*Step 4: Verify the changes*

Once the deployment is complete:
1. Click on the pod circle
2. Click on the pod name
3. Get into the `Terminal` tab
4. Verify that your `application.properties` are now available in the
`config` folder

....
sh-4.2$ ls config
application.properties
sh-4.2$ cat config/application.properties
# replace your own values based on the database service you created
# url = jdbc:mysql://<<service-host>>:<<service-port>>/<<dbname>>?useSSL=false
spring.datasource.platform=mysql
spring.datasource.url= jdbc:mysql://mysql.spring-userxx:3306/sampledb?useSSL=false
spring.datasource.username=user
spring.datasource.password=password
....

Note the contents of this file are what you added to the ConfigMap.

*Step 5: Test your application*

Go back to the `Overview` page. Click on your application url which
would be something like
`http://bootapp-spring-userxx.{{APPS_ADDRESS}}/`

It will open a new tab and your running application will greet you

`Hello from bootapp-2-06a4b`

Now move back to your webconsole and watch the pod logs.

Now access the application with the `/dbtest` extension -
`http://bootapp-spring-userxx.{{APPS_ADDRESS}}/dbtest`

It should show the data from your MySQL database.

....
Customers List


CustomerId: 2 Customer Name: Joe Mysql Age: 88
CustomerId: 3 Customer Name: Jack Mysql Age: 54
CustomerId: 4 Customer Name: Ann Mysql Age: 32
....

Where did this data come from? Look at *
https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app/blob/master/src/main/resources/schema-mysql.sql
was used to initialize the MySQL database *
https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app/blob/master/src/main/resources/data-mysql.sql
was used to populate data. I added 'Mysql' as part of the names to make
it easy ;)

Also note that your logs show the connection url, just to verify which
database you are connecting to.

....
connection url: jdbc:mysql://mysql.spring-userxx:3306/sampledb?useSSL=false
....

*Bonus Points:* Log into the MySQL instance and verify the data in the
customer table for extra points!!

In this lab exercise, you have learnt how to set up a multi-tiered
application and also to pass configuration information using ConfigMaps.
In the next lab, we will learn to use ConfigMaps to dynamically update
the configuration without restarting the pod!!
