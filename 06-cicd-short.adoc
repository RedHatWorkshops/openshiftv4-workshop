== Creating a Pipeline

In this lab, we will learn to create a build pipeline on OpenShift. This
pipeline will be setup using Jenkins running as an application pod on
OpenShift. The pipeline running on Jenkins will trigger builds and
deployments on OpenShift.


=== Create a new project

=== Create Project
IMPORTANT: Please replace *Username* with your username

- login to web UI via {{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}
- Use the same username and password that assigned to you
- Click `Developer` under `Administrator` to switch to Developer persona
- Click onto `Project` on the top
- Click `Create Project`

- Enter *pipeline-Username* as name of the project. The display name and description is optional.

- Alternatively, you can run this command below via CLI.

=== Deploy your CI/CD tool (Jenkins)

- Login to the cluster via {{API_URL}}

```
[~]$ oc login {{API_URL}}
The server uses a certificate signed by an unknown authority.
You can bypass the certificate check, but any data you send to the server could be intercepted
by others.
Use insecure connections? (y/n): y

Authentication required for {{API_URL}} (openshift)
Username: user1
Password:
Login successful.
```

== Deploy OOTB Jenkins

- Navigate to `+Add`
- Click on `From Catalog`

- Click `Jenkins (Ephemeral)`
- Click `Instantiate Template`
- Take the default values and click `Create`
- Navigate to `Topology`
- Click onto the middle of the Jenkins icon to see the details
- Wait for the solid blue ring shows on the icon
- Click onto the route link to go to Jenkins Console

- Click `Advanced`
- Click the link where `Proceed to jenkins-...`
- Click `Log in with OpenShift`

image::jenkins-login.png[image]

- Click `htpasswd`
- Login using your user name
- Click `Allow selected permissions`
- You now login the Jenkins console

=== Pipeline setup

- Create pipeline via web terminal

[source,shell]
----

[~]$ oc project pipeline-userx
[~]$ oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/origin/master/examples/jenkins/pipeline/nodejs-sample-pipeline.yaml

buildconfig.build.openshift.io/nodejs-sample-pipeline created
----

- Grant permissions to jenkins sevice account for access to the project.

```
[~] $ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin system:serviceaccount:pipeline-Username:jenkins -n pipeline-Username
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/admin added: "system:serviceaccount:pipeline-Username:jenkins"
```
NOTE:
NOTE: *pipeline-Username* will be replaced to your project name

- Go back to your web console {{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}
- Navigate to `Build` --> `Build Configs`
- Click onto `nodejs-sample-pipeline`
- Click `Actions` dropdown on the top right
- Select `Start Build`
- Build starts as show below

image::jenkins-viewlog.png[image]

- Click `View Logs`
- Click `Open Blue Ocean` from the Jenkins Console

image::jenkins-build.png[image]

- Blue Ocean console here (may take a minute to show up):

image::blue-ocean.png[image]

- Go back to OpenShift web console

image::pipeline-build.png[image]

- When Pipleline build is completed, navigate `Network` --> `Route`
- Click onto the link under `LOCATION` for `nodejs-mongodb-example`

Congratulations!! In this lab, you have learnt how to set up and run
your own CI/CD pipeline on OpenShift.
