== Create an App from a Container image

In this lab you will learn how to create a new project on OpenShift and
how to create an application from an existing docker image using Web UI.

=== Add a new project

IMPORTANT: Please replace *Username* with your username

- login to web UI via {{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}
- Use the same username and password that assigned to you
- On the left-hand side menu, select `Home` and then select `Project`
- Click `Create Project`
- Enter *web-terminal-Username* as name of the project. The display name and description is optional.

=== Deploy an Image

- Click `Deploy Image`, or in the top-right, click the *Add* drop-down menu and select `Deploy Image`
- Enter `quay.io/openshiftlabs/workshop-terminal:2.4.0` in the `Image Name` box,
  noting that there's no `http://`, enter exactly as shown here,
  without the quotes, and then select the magnifying glass to the right of the box,
  this will show you more information about the image.
- Click on search icon:

- Enter a Name for the deployment
- Scroll down a bit and provide an environment variable.
- Add `OC_VERSION` and `4.1` as `Environment Variable` at the bottom on the page.

- Click `Deploy`
- On the left-hand side menu, select `Workload` and then select `Deployments Configs`
- Click onto the `Deployment config`, you will see the deployment details here

- click the tab `Pods` to watch the deployment to complete

- On the left-hand side menu, select `Home` and then select `Events` to check status on each events. Events in OpenShift Container Platform are modeled based on events that happen to API objects in an OpenShift Container Platform cluster. Events allow OpenShift Container Platform to record information about real-world events in a resource-agnostic manner.

== Create route

Next we need to create a route so we can access this application from the outside of OpenShift (i.e. from the internet).

- On the left-hand side menu, select `Networking` and then select `Routes`
- Click `create route` in the top-left
- Enter `workshop-terminal` for the name of the route, leave the hostname and path the default, select `workshop-terminal` from the list of services in the `Service` menu, and select the only port in the `Target Port` drop down (should be port 10080 --> 10080), like this:

- When you're ready, click `Create` at the bottom and it will create the route.
- You will now be presented with a pane that shows the overview of the route:

=== Accessing the terminal

- In the top right hand side of the route details page, you will see the `Location` which will be the routable URL that will provide access to our workshop terminal.
- Click on this and you should now see the in-browser terminal session that we can use (if preferred, or mandated due to connectivity issues):

- Execute the following in the terminal:

```
$ wget https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v3/clients/4.1.0-201904090034.git.0.1016bda.el7/linux/oc.tar.gz
$ tar zvxf oc.tar.gz
$ mv oc /opt/app-root/bin/
$ oc version
```


Congratulations!! You now know how to create a project, an application
using an external docker image and navigate around. You can use this terminal
to access the cluster via CLI.
