== Create an App from a Container image

In this lab you will learn how to create a new project on OpenShift and
how to create an application from an existing docker image using Web UI.

=== Add a new project

IMPORTANT: Please replace *Username* with your username

- login to web UI via {{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}
- Use the same username and password that assigned to you
- Click `Developer` under `Administrator` to switch to Developer persona
- Click onto `Project` on the top
- Click `Create Project`

- Enter *web-terminal-Username* as name of the project. The display name and description is optional.

=== Deploy an Image

- Click `+Add` on the left menu
- Click onto `Container Image` to deploy an image

- Enter `quay.io/openshiftlabs/workshop-terminal:2.4.0` in the `Image Name` box,
  noting that there's no `http://`, enter exactly as shown here,
  without the quotes
- Select the magnifying glass icon to the right of the box
- Use the default `Name` for the deployment

- Click onto `Deployment Configuration` link at the bottom of the page
- Add `OC_VERSION` and `4.2` as `Environment Variable` in the `Deployment Configuration` section

- Click `Create`
- You will be on the Topology view

- click onto the middle of the icon, the details page shows on the right

- Click `DC workshop-terminal`
- Click `Events` tab

Events in OpenShift Container Platform are modeled based on events that happen
to API objects in an OpenShift Container Platform cluster. Events allow OpenShift
Container Platform to record information about real-world events in a resource-
agnostic manner. For more information, please see
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.2/nodes/clusters/nodes-containers-events.html

== Accessing to the Terminal

Next we need to learn how to get to the route of the image, so we can access this application from the outside of OpenShift (i.e. from the internet).

- Navigate to `Topology` on the left
- Click on the icon where is shown with the bubble

- the terminal will be opened on a separated browser tab

=== Setting up OC CLI on the terminal

- Execute the following in the terminal from the route link:

....
$ wget https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/{{VERSION}}/openshift-client-linux-{{VERSION}}.tar.gz
$ tar zvxf openshift-client-linux-{{VERSION}}.tar.gz
$ mv oc /opt/app-root/bin/
$ oc version
....

NOTE: If normal cut/paste does not work, you can try to use browser's edit menu for cut/paste.

=== To login to a remote server

[source,shell]
----
$ oc login {{API_URL}}
----

NOTE: Username and password will be provided by your instructor.


Congratulations!! You now know how to create a project, an application
using an external docker image and navigate around. You also install OC CLI on
the web terminal to access the cluster via CLI.
